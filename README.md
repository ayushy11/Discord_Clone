## Installation and Setup Instructions

For the regular react app process you will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

`npm install`    

To Start Server:

`npm run build && npm start`  

To Visit App:

`localhost:3000`  

## How does it work

Once the app is started you should see the login page. Once you click login, firebase authentication takes it from there and asks you to login to your account & You will be redirected back to the main page.
